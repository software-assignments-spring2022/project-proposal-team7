# Project Proposal

### Project title

Wordly

### What and why?

A new wave of word puzzle games inspired by the online game Wordle has overtaken the mobile game market, however the existing options for apps and websites are not without fault. The game works by randomly choosing a five letter word which you have to guess within six tries, with the game telling you which of the letters of your guess are correct. Having been acquired by the New York Times the original Wordle is all too likely going to be put behind a pay wall, and each of the clones of the game are buggy, overloaded with advertisements, and make no changes to the rules of Wordle. I propose making a web app to fix some of the issues present in both wordle and its clones; namely the ability to play more than once a day, options to vary word lengths / difficulty and add an in app leaderboard.

### For whom?

There is already a large number of people interested in Wordle as posting your scores on social media has become very popular amongst younger internet users. Similarly long time fans of other word puzzle games such as regular crosswords have taken to the game as well.

### How?

This proposed replacement for Wordle should use the aspects of wordle which have made it so popular but iron out the kinks (which wordle players have already taken to vocally complaining about online). The format of the game is sound with how it has you come closer to the correct word with each subsequent guess, but the users are unable to play for more than a few minutes each day. With this proposed replacement users can vary the complexity of the words they're guessing by choosing different word lengths, alter the difficulty by changing the number of guesses per word, and keep track of their own play history via stats in a leaderboard (which can replace the already popular habit of simply posting your own stats on twitter).

### Scope

I believe this proposal is well within the scope of the class. Each of the features proposed cna be implemented with the technologies laid out for the course, but have the oppurtunity to be made more robust if the core functionality is completed before the end of the semester.
